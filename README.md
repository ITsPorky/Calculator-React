#### Overcoming Challenges

In the pursuit of project completion, several challenges were encountered and successfully addressed:

- **Challenge 1: React.js**
  - Overcame by dedicating time to learn and research React.js to be able to create this project.

- **Challenge 2: Creating React components and using prop data**
  - Dedicated time to learn and undestand how react components work and how to utilise props to pass data into the component.

- **Challenge 3: Converting data types**
  - Referenced javascript documentation to use inbuilt methods for converting strings to integers and vice versa.
